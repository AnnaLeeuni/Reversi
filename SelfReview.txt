Initially we were shocked by the provider's view that we received which was completely different
from the requirements. Their view just looks like a square board plus a triangle board under it.
But we read through the design of their implementation of view and found it was quite clear and
impossible to incorporate it wit our view in our game.

Still, there are many design issues with the code they sent to us. Most of the class for example,
gameFrame didn't take in an interface of their model, which makes it extremely difficult for future
extension.

Some of the public methods in provider's code are inside the class rather than interface. We also
noticed that we had similar issues in our code. Those are the things we think we can do better
next time. That we should be more careful with the design of our public methods.

We also have some trust issues. Because their view was so buggy, we began to wondering if the rest of
the code they sent to us were still as broken as their view. Therefore, when's exception been thrown,
their implementation was the first thing we went through. But those other stuff turns out to be
fine.

Despite the code, Our providers are nice person. Every times we ask for clarification, they
responded in time and with details. We thought it was very helpful.
